# Loop Summarization for Smart Contracts

## Getting started

1. Download ([link](https://racket-lang.org/download/)) and install Racket (v7
   or later) if you do not already have it installed on your system.
   - Make sure that the Racket binaries are available on your `PATH`.
2. Run the tool with `src/loopsum.rkt`, e.g.,
   `racket src/loopsum.rkt examples/test1.dsl`.
